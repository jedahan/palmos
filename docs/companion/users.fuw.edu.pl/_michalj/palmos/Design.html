The previous chapter described at a very high level the sorts of issues involved with writing a Palm OS<sup>&#174;</sup> application. This chapter goes into much more detail about what is appropriate application design and user interface design.

Your application will integrate well with others if you follow the guidelines in this section. Integrate with the system software as follows:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="924978"> </a><br><li>Handle <code>sysAppLaunchCmdNormalLaunch</code><br><a name="924980"> </a><br><li>Handle or ignore <em>other application launch codes</em> as appropriate.

This is important if your application returns to the last displayed view by default.<br><a name="925011"> </a><br><li>If your application uses the <em>serial port</em>, be sure to free the port when you no longer need it so that the HotSync<sup>&#174;</sup> application can use it. <br><a name="925013"> </a><br><li>Ensure that your application properly handles the global find. Generally, searches and sorts aren't case sensitive. <br><a name="925015"> </a><br><li>If your application supports <em>private records</em>, be sure they are unavailable to the global find when they should be hidden.<br><a name="925017"> </a><br><li>The <em>application name</em> is defined in two ways: <br><dl><a name="925018"> </a><p></p><dt>The application name (required) is specified in the PalmRez panel of your CodeWarrior project and used by HotSync, the About box, the Memory display, and the database header. <p></p><ul type="CIRCLE"><a name="925020"> </a><li>The application icon name (optional) is a string resource in the application's resource file. It is used by the launcher screen and in the Button Assignment preferences panel (available in OS versions 2.0 and later).

Because of HotSync and Preferences, don't assume the application data is the same as it was when the user looked at it last. </ul><a name="925044"> </a><br><li>If your application uses sounds, be sure it uses the Warning and Confirmation sounds properly.<br></ul></dl><a name="925046"> </a><h3> Naming Conventions</h3><dl><a name="925049"> </a><p></p><dt>The following conventions are used throughout the Palm OS API:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925051"> </a><br><li>Functions start with a capital letter.<br><a name="925052"> </a><br><li>All functions belonging to a particular manager start with a two- or three-letter prefix, such as "Ctl" for control functions or "Ftr" for functions that are part of the feature manager.<br><a name="925054"> </a><br><li>Events and other constants start with a lowercase letter.<br><a name="925056"> </a><br><li>Structure elements start with a lowercase letter. <br><a name="925057"> </a><br><li>Global variables start with a capital letter. <br><a name="925058"> </a><br><li>Typedefs start with a capital letter and end with "Type" (for example, <code>DateFormatType</code>, found in <code>DateTime.h</code>).<br><a name="925060"> </a><br><li>Macintosh ResEdit resource types usually start with a lowercase letter followed by three capital letters, for example tSTR or tTBL. (Customized Macintosh resources provided with your developer package are all uppercase, for example, MENU. Some resources, such as Talt, don't follow the conventions.)<br><a name="925061"> </a><br><li>Members of an enumerated type start with a lowercase prefix followed by a name starting with a capital letter, as follows:<br></ul><dl><a name="925062"> </a><br><code>enum formObjects {</code><br></dl><dl><a name="925063"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmFieldObj,</code><br><a name="925064"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmControlObj,</code><br><a name="925065"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmListObj,</code><br><a name="925066"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmTableObj,</code><br><a name="925067"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmBitmapObj,</code><br><a name="925068"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmLineObj,</code><br><a name="925069"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmFrameObj,</code><br><a name="925070"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmRectangleObj,</code><br><a name="925071"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmLabelObj,</code><br><a name="925072"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmTitleObj,</code><br><a name="925073"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmPopupObj,</code><br><a name="925074"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmGraffitiStateObj,</code><br><a name="925075"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	 frmGadgetObj};</code><br><a name="925076"> </a><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp typedef enum formObjects FormObjectKind;</code><br></dl></dl><a name="925078"> </a><h3> Achieving Optimum Performance</h3><dl><a name="925080"> </a><p></p><dt>Because the Palm OS device has limited heap space and storage, optimization is critical. The Palm OS device currently has no wait cursor, so users will expect rapid response. Test for performance. Launching, switching, and finding should be fast.<a name="925081"> </a><p></p><dt>To make your application as fast and efficient as possible, optimize for heap space first, speed second, code size third.<a name="925082"> </a><p></p><dt>Follow these guidelines to optimize memory use: <ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925084"> </a><br><li><em>Allocate handles</em> for your memory to avoid heap fragmentation. <br><a name="925086"> </a><br><li><em>Sort on demand</em>; don't keep different sort lists around. This makes your program simpler and requires less storage. <br><a name="925088"> </a><br><li><em>Dynamic memory</em> is a potential bottleneck. Don't put large structures on the stack. <br><a name="925090"> </a><br><li><em>Arrange subroutines</em> within the application to avoid 32K jumps. <br><a name="925091"> </a><br><li>To have your application run well within the constraints of the limited dynamic heap, follow these guidelines: <br><p></p><ul type="CIRCLE"><a name="925093"> </a><li>Allocate memory chunks instead of using global variables where possible.<a name="925094"> </a><li>Switch from one UI form to another instead of stacking up dialog boxes. <a name="925096"> </a><li>Edit database records in place; don't make extra copies on the dynamic heap. </ul><a name="925098"> </a><br><li>Avoid placing large amounts of data on the stack. Heap corruption is hard to debug. Global variables are preferable to local variables (however, chunks are preferable to global variables). Your application only has from 2K or 4K of stack space depending on the system software version. <br></ul></dl><a name="925101"> </a><h3> Assigning a Creator ID</h3><dl><a name="925104"> </a><p></p><dt>Each Palm OS application has a distinct creator ID. A creator ID is a 4-byte value used to tie together all the databases related to the application. <a name="925105"> </a><p></p><dt>Creator IDs are unique to the application, not the creator of the application. Each database on the Palm device has an application value and a type. The type value should be set to <code>sysFileTApplication</code> for the executable's database and can be set to any value for other databases associated with an application. <a name="925106"> </a><p></p><dt>Creator IDs need to be either all caps or mixed case. The Palm OS creator IDs differ from the creator ID and type that appear in the CodeWarrior Project Settings dialog boxes. <a name="925107"> </a><p></p><dt>The creator ID for a Palm OS application is assigned in the PalmRez Project Settings panel. <ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925108"> </a><br><li>The Type should be set to <code>APPL. </code>Type is a 4-byte value. <br><a name="925109"> </a><br><li>For information about creator IDs, and to register a creator ID, see this web page:<br></ul><dl><a name="925110"> </a><br><code><code>http://www.palmos.com/dev/crid/cridsub.html</code></code><br><dl><a name="925111"> </a><p></p><dt>The system uses the creator ID in various ways:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925112"> </a><br><li>Creator ID and type is used by the system launcher window to determine which databases are applications that should be displayed for selection. <br><a name="925113"> </a><br><li>The memory application uses a creator ID and type to determine names of applications for display and to calculate total memory used by an application. <br></ul></dl></dl></dl><a name="925115"> </a><h3> Working With Databases</h3><dl><a name="925116"> </a><p></p><dt>Working properly with databases makes your application run faster and synchronize without problems. Follow these suggestions: <ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925121"> </a><br><li>When the user deletes a record, call <code><a href="DataAndResourceManager.html#925735"></code>DmDeleteRecord<code></a></code> to remove all data from the record, not <code><a href="DataAndResourceManager.html#927011"></code>DmRemoveRecord<code></a></code> to remove the record itself. That way, the desktop application can retrieve the information that the record is deleted the next time there is a HotSync. <br><dl><a name="925126"> </a><p></p><dt><strong>Note</strong>: If your application doesn't have an associated conduit, call <code>DmRemoveRecord</code> to completely remove the record.</dl><a name="925128"> </a><br><li>Keep data in database records compact. To avoid performance problems, Palm OS databases are not compressed, but all data are tightly packed. This pays off for storage and during HotSync. <br><a name="925129"> </a><br><li>All records in a database should be of the same type and format. This is not a requirement, but is highly recommended to avoid processing overhead. <br><a name="925130"> </a><br><li>Be sure your application modifies the flags in the database header appropriately when the user deletes or otherwise modifies information. This flag modification is only required if you're synchronizing with the Palm PIM applications.<br><a name="925132"> </a><br><li>Don't display deleted records. <br><a name="925137"> </a><br><li>Call <code><a href="DataAndResourceManager.html#927326"></code>DmSetDatabaseInfo<code></a></code> when creating a database to assign a version number to your application. Databases default to version 0 if the version isn't explicitly set. <br><a name="925142"> </a><br><li>Call <code><a href="DataAndResourceManager.html#925528"></code>DmDatabaseInfo<code></a></code> to check the database version at application start-up.<br></ul></dl><a name="925149"> </a><h3> Writing Robust Code</h3><dl><a name="925150"> </a><p></p><dt>To make your programs more robust and to increase their compatibility with the next generation of Palm Computing products, it is strongly recommended that you follow the guidelines and practices outlined in this section. <ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925151"> </a><br><li>Check assumptions<br><dl><a name="925152"> </a><p></p><dt>You can write defensive code by adding frequent calls to the <a href="ErrorManager.html#925117">ErrNonFatalDisplayIf</a> function, which enables your debug builds to check assumptions. Many bugs are caught in this way, and these "extra" calls don't weigh down your shipping application. You can keep more important checks in the release builds by using the <a href="ErrorManager.html#925092">ErrFatalDisplayIf</a> function.</dl><a name="925159"> </a><br><li>Avoid continual polling<br><dl><a name="925160"> </a><p></p><dt>To conserve the battery, avoid continual polling. If your application is in a wait loop, poll at short intervals (for example, every tenth of a second) instead. The event loop of the Hardball example application included with your Palm OS SDK illustrates how to do this. </dl><a name="925162"> </a><br><li>Avoid reading and writing to <code>NULL</code> (or low memory) <br><dl><a name="925168"> </a><p></p><dt>When calling functions that allocate memory (<a href="MemoryManager.html#925775">MemSet</a>, <a href="MemoryManager.html#925502">MemMove</a> and similar functions) make sure that the pointers they return are non-<code>NULL</code>. (If you can do better validation than that, so much the better.) Also check that pointers your code obtains from structures or other function calls are not <code>NULL</code>. Consider adding to your debug build a <code>#define</code> that overrides <a href="MemoryManager.html#925502">MemMove</a> (and similar functions) with a version that validates the arguments passed to it.</dl><a name="925173"> </a><br><li>Use dynamic heap space frugally<br><dl><a name="925174"> </a><p></p><dt>It is important not to use the extra dynamic heap space available on Palm units running 2.0 and higher unless it is truly necessary to do so. Wasteful use of heap space may limit your application to running only on the latest devices--which prevents it from running on the very large number of units already in the marketplace.<a name="925175"> </a><p></p><dt>Note that some system services, such as the IrDA stack or the Find window, can require additional memory while your application is running; for example, if the unit starts to receive a beam or other external input, the system may need to allocate additional heap space for the incoming data. Don't use all available dynamic memory just because it's there; instead, consider using the storage heap for working with large amounts of temporary data.</dl><a name="925176"> </a><br><li>Check result codes when allocating memory<br><dl><a name="925177"> </a><p></p><dt>Because future devices may have larger or smaller amounts of available memory, it is always a good idea to check result codes carefully when allocating memory. It's also good practice to use the storage heap (and possibly file streams) to work with large objects.</dl><a name="925178"> </a><br><li>Avoid allocating zero-length objects<br><dl><a name="925179"> </a><p></p><dt>It's not valid to allocate a zero-byte buffer, or to resize a buffer to zero bytes. Palm OS 2.0 and previous releases allowed this practice, but future revisions of the OS may not permit zero-length objects.</dl><a name="925180"> </a><br><li>Avoid making assumptions about the screen<br><dl><a name="925181"> </a><p></p><dt>The location of the screen buffer, its size, and the number of pixels per bit aren't set in stone--they might well change. Don't hack around the windowing and drawing functions. If you are going to hack the hardware to circumvent the APIs, save the state and return the system to that saved state when you quit.</dl><a name="925182"> </a><br><li>Don't access globals or hardware directly<br><dl><a name="925183"> </a><p></p><dt>Global variables and their locations can change; to avoid mishaps, use the documented API functions and disable your application if it is run on anything but a tested version of the OS. Future devices might run on a different processor than the current one.<a name="925184"> </a><p></p><dt>Similarly, don't hardcode references to cards. Although current Palm OS hardware provides only a single card slot, this may not always be the case. Thus, when calling functions that manipulate cards, such as database manager and file streaming functions, pass a variable that references the target card, rather than passing a hardcoded reference to card 0.</dl><a name="925185"> </a><br><li>Built-in applications can change<br><dl><a name="925186"> </a><p></p><dt>The format and size of the preferences (and data) for the built-in applications is subject to change. Write your code defensively, and consider disabling your application if it is run on an untested version of the OS.</dl></ul></dl><a name="925188"> </a><h3> Avoiding Potential Pitfalls</h3><dl><a name="925189"> </a><p></p><dt>Certain problems are encountered by application developers again and again. To avoid them, ask yourself these questions:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925190"> </a><br><li>Do you have a Creator ID for your application? <br><dl><a name="925191"> </a><p></p><dt>Each application (not just each company) has to have a Creator ID. Note that the Creator ID is only needed for the application (database of type APPL) not for all other databases. </dl><a name="925194"> </a><br><li>Did you use C library calls in your application? If you did, change them to corresponding Palm OS calls. <br></ul></dl><a name="925197"> </a><h2> User Interface Guidelines</h2><dl><a name="925200"> </a><p></p><dt>The Palm OS device is designed for rapid entry and quick retrieval of information. To maximize performance, the UI should minimize navigation between windows, opening of dialog boxes, and so on. The layout of application screens needs to be simple so that the user can pick up the product and use it effectively after a short time. It's especially helpful if the UI of your application is consistent with other applications on the device so users work with familiar patterns. <a name="925201"> </a><p></p><dt>This section helps you design a user interface that's intuitive, easy to use, and consistent with other applications on the device.

Speed is therefore a critical design objective for hand-held organizers and is not limited to execution speed of the code. The total time needed to navigate, select, and execute commands can have a big impact on overall efficiency.<a name="925240"> </a><p></p><dt>The user should be able to keep up with someone on the telephone when setting up appointments, looking up phone numbers, and so on.

In reality, some commands are used very frequently while most are used only rarely. Similarly, some settings are more likely to be used than others. For example, a 3 p.m.- 4 p.m. meeting occurs much more frequently than a 3:25 to 4:15 meeting. <a name="925247"> </a><p></p><dt>More frequently used commands and settings should be easier to find and faster to execute.<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925248"> </a><br><li>Frequently executed software commands should be accessible by one tap.<br><a name="925249"> </a><br><li>Infrequently used commands may require more user action.<br><p><a name="925275"> </a> </p><p><div> <table border="3"><caption><B></B></caption><tr><td><a name="925252"> </a><strong>Frequency </strong></td><td><a name="925254"> </a><strong>Example </strong></td><td><a name="925256"> </a><strong>Accessibility</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a name="925258"> </a>Several times per hour.</td><td><a name="925260"> </a>Checking today's schedule or to-do items.</td><td><a name="925262"> </a>One tap.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925264"> </a>Several times per day.</td><td><a name="925266"> </a>One hour meeting starting at the top of the hour.</td><td><a name="925268"> </a>One tap, write in place.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925270"> </a>Several times per week.</td><td><a name="925272"> </a>Setting a weekly meeting (repeating event).</td><td><a name="925274"> </a>Several taps, second dialog box.</td></tr></table><table><tr><td></table></div></p></ul><a name="925277"> </a><p></p><dt>To make your application easily accessible, follow these guidelines:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925279"> </a><br><li>Minimize the number of taps to execute a function or change a setting.<br><a name="925281"> </a><br><li>Provide command buttons for commonly executed multistep operations.

Advanced commands should be easily accessible but should not be in the way.<a name="925298"> </a><p></p><dt>The design must therefore fit the following criteria:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925299"> </a><br><li>Indicate clearly where in an application the user is. The PIM applications and modal dialog boxes have black title bars that usually indicate the application name and view.<br><a name="925300"> </a><br><li>Make it obvious to the user how to get to different views. The command buttons provide the best example of achieving this.<br><a name="925301"> </a><br><li>Use buttons for important commands. <br><a name="925302"> </a><br><li>Accomplishing common tasks should be fast and easy. Minimizing steps helps not only speed but ease of use.<br></ul><a name="925303"> </a><p></p><dt>Ease of use amounts to a series of trade-offs. Striking the best balance for the most people is the biggest challenge of UI design. For example: <ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925304"> </a><br><li>Consistency reduces the time needed to learn an application by limiting the number of things that people need to keep in their heads at once. The user should not have to memorize an entire set of rules to use the device easily, for example, the up arrow key should not do different things on different screens.<br><a name="925305"> </a><br><li>Choose the number of buttons on the screen diligently: <br><p></p><ul type="CIRCLE"><a name="925306"> </a><li>The fewer buttons on the screen, the less time it takes to learn how to use the product. <a name="925307"> </a><li>However, keeping a few frequently used buttons on screen helps reduce the time spent learning basic functionality.</ul><a name="925309"> </a><br><li>Advanced features should not be in the way for beginners, but should not require multiple-step searching.<br><a name="925310"> </a><br><li>If possible, make your application consistent with the Palm OS device's native applications; users are used to interacting with them and will easily get used to your application if you follow these rules. <br></ul></dl><a name="925312"> </a><h3> Creating a Palm OS User Interface</h3><dl><a name="925313"> </a><p></p><dt>The small screen and pen-based user interaction require a different UI paradigm than a desktop computer. Here are some guidelines for making your application's interface consistent with other applications, including the PIM applications.<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925315"> </a><br><li>Provide an <em>application icon</em> for the Launcher. To launch an application, users navigate to the launcher screen and tap on an icon. Choose a short icon name and an easy to recognize icon.<br><dl><a name="925316"> </a><p></p><dt>Specify the Application Icon Name and Application Icon using the Project Settings panel in Constructor. </dl><a name="925317"> </a><br><li>Provide a <em>base screen</em> that offers an overview of all available information. This screen is typically a list view. Not all applications need a base screen.<br><a name="925318"> </a><br><li>Allow users to view most record information by pressing the <em>navigation keys</em>. Each event, to-do item, address, memo page, and so on is called a record.<br><a name="925320"> </a><br><li>Organize records into user-defined <em>categories</em> if that makes sense. Categories usually result in more efficient screen use. Users can switch between categories using a popup menu or can display all records at once. <br><a name="925321"> </a><br><li>Detailed information and advanced navigation require the use of a stylus. See <a href="Design.html#925400">Data Entry Guidelines</a> for different data entry modes.<br><a name="925326"> </a><br><li>Don't require double taps.<br><a name="925327"> </a><br><li>Don't gray out menu commands or other UI elements; instead, remove an element when it's not available. <br><a name="925329"> </a><br><li>If you can, allow finger navigation. For finger navigation, buttons need to be big enough for the system to recognize which button has been pushed. This is done by the Palm OS system software. <br><a name="925331"> </a><br><li>Consider overloading the buttons. If you do overload, release the buttons at every possible opportunity. This is useful only for certain applications, such as games.<br></ul><a name="925332"> </a><p></p><dt>This section provides information on a variety of UI design issues:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925336"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925358">Navigation Guidelines</a> <br><a name="925340"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925386">Preferences Guidelines</a> <br><a name="925344"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925400">Data Entry Guidelines</a> <br><a name="925348"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925450">Command Execution Guidelines</a> <br><a name="925352"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925458">Guidelines for Screen Layout</a> <br><a name="925356"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925514">Guidelines for Dialog Box Layout</a> <br></ul></dl><a name="925358"> </a><h4> Navigation Guidelines</h4><dl><a name="925360"> </a><p></p><dt>Users can move through applications by the following methods:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925362"> </a><br><li><strong>Switching applications</strong>. Users press the physical buttons representing the PIM applications or access a launcher to switch applications.<br><dl><a name="925364"> </a><p></p><dt>On Palm OS 2.0 or later devices, users can assign each button to the application of their choice using a Preferences panel. <a name="925365"> </a><p></p><dt>When switching to an application, the user is either presented with a standard first screen or returned to the last place in that application. </dl><a name="925367"> </a><br><li><strong>Switching views</strong>. Each PIM application has two or more views (or modes) typically<br><p></p><ul type="CIRCLE"><a name="925368"> </a><li>a list view (or view mode) <a name="925369"> </a><li>an edit view (or edit mode) <dl><a name="925370"> </a><p></p><dt>The user taps on records or uses command buttons to toggle between these views. <a name="925371"> </a><p></p><dt>Edit mode gives users access to the Details button for settings that affect the entire record. They can also access specific menu commands for records. In many applications, tapping on a record switches the application to edit mode and displays an input cursor. </dl></ul><a name="925372"> </a><br><li><strong>Switching categories of records</strong>. A popup menu in the top right corner lets users switch between categories. The popup menu is found in the list view of applications that support categories.<br><a name="925374"> </a><br><li><strong>Switching records in applications</strong>. Depending on the application, the user can scroll through lists of records, then tap on a record or a Details button for further information. <br><a name="925377"> </a><br><li><strong>Graffiti navigation. </strong>Support Graffiti navigation: <br><p></p><ul type="CIRCLE"><a name="925378"> </a><li>Left-right-forward-backward movement as part of a field's behavior.<a name="925379"> </a><li>Getting to next and previous screen using the down/up and up/down keystrokes. </ul><a name="925381"> </a><br><li><strong>Cycling through categories</strong>. Holding the button on the hard case cycles through all categories. <br><a name="925382"> </a><br><li><strong>Scrolling</strong>. Records too long to display in one screen are scrollable. On-screen scroll buttons allow users to move up or down one line at a time. The physical arrow buttons allow users to move up and down one page at a time. <br><dl><a name="925384"> </a><p></p><dt>Scrollbars were introduced in OS 2.0. Scrollbars are optional. Developers have to consider the trade-off between taking up 7 pixels of horizontal space (the width of the scroll bar) vs. providing convenient scrolling for long lists of records. </dl></ul></dl><a name="925386"> </a><h4> Preferences Guidelines</h4><dl><a name="925388"> </a><p></p><dt>Palm OS 2.0 and later has improved preferences facilities. They are available through launch codes, discussed in the chapter <a href="AppLaunchCodes.html#924904">"Application Launch Codes"</a> in the <em>Palm OS SDK Reference</em>. <a name="925392"> </a><p></p><dt>The system now offers application-specific panels, sticky panels, and quick switch, as follows:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925393"> </a><br><li><strong>Application-specific panels</strong>. Applications can add application-specific preferences panels to follow the system panels when the user cycles though the preferences. To do so, use the common code provided in the <code>Formats</code> example application to make the pull-down menu available. If the application uses the common code, a Done button inserts itself if the panel was called from the application, not sequentially following another panel. <br><a name="925394"> </a><br><li><strong>Sticky panels</strong>. When users bring up a preference panel from the launcher, exit the panel, then bring it up again, the system returns to the last panel used. <br><a name="925395"> </a><br><li><strong>Quick switch</strong>. Applications can now use the launch codes <code>sysAppLaunchCmdPanelCalledFromApp</code> and <code>sysAppLaunchCmdReturnFromPanel</code>, which allow an application to let users change preferences without first selecting the launcher, then selecting the application again. <br></ul></dl><a name="925400"> </a><h4> Data Entry Guidelines</h4><dl><a name="925401"> </a><p></p><dt>Users can enter data by the following methods:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925403"> </a><br><li><strong>Graffiti.</strong> Graffiti characters are written in the text area on the digitizer and appear on the screen at the cursor location. The user specifies the cursor location by tapping directly on the screen with the stylus.<br><dl><a name="925404"> </a><p></p><dt>Some controls accept input from Graffiti: For example, in the time selector dialog, you can write the time into the Graffiti area and it appears as start time or end time. The "next field" stroke switches between start and end time. The "Return" stroke dismisses the dialog. <a name="925405"> </a><p></p><dt>For 2.0 and later applications, users expect that your application includes the Graffiti Reference option. You can include this option by calling <code><a href="SystemDialogs.html#926213"></code>SysGraffitiReferenceDialog<code></a></code>. </dl><a name="925410"> </a><br><li><strong>On-screen keyboard</strong>. In place of using Graffiti, the user can tap an on-screen keyboard with the stylus. Any text is entered into a temporary window. When the user dismisses the keyboard, the system inserts that text at the cursor location.<br><a name="925412"> </a><br><li><strong>Controls</strong>. Buttons, check boxes, and popup lists provide a quick way to enter settings and select options.<br><a name="925413"> </a><br><li><strong>HotSync</strong>. The user can type data on the PC and download it to the Palm OS device. <br><a name="925414"> </a><br><li><strong>Auto-creation</strong>. Many applications, such as the DateBook or the Memo Pad provide an auto-create feature. If the user starts to write in a list view with no record selected, a new record is created with no additional interaction. <br></ul><a name="925415"> </a><p></p><dt>To provide a consistent interface, follow these guidelines when designing the data entry interface for your application:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925416"> </a><br><li>Let users perform basic data entry in place. <br><a name="925418"> </a><br><li>Have the cursor ready and visible if there's only one field for text entry (saves one tap). <br><a name="925419"> </a><br><li>Provide a Details dialog for more elaborate data entry. <br><a name="925421"> </a><br><li>Use the following format in the Details dialog: <br></ul><dl><a name="925422"> </a><br><code>Item (right-justified): Value(left-justified)</code><br><dl><a name="925423"> </a><p></p><dt>for example:<p><a name="925424"> </a> </p><p><a name="925434"> </a> </p><p><div> <table border="3"><caption><B></B></caption><tr><td><a name="925427"> </a>Set Date:</td><td><a name="925429"> </a><code>4-1-96</code> </td></tr><tr><td><a name="925431"> </a>Auto-off after:</td><td><a name="925433"> </a><code>2 minutes</code> </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></table></div></p><ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925435"> </a><br><li>Don't nest dialog boxes too deeply.<br><a name="925436"> </a><br><li>Provide only one interface per function, that is, allow users to interact with an application through either a button, menu, or popup list.

Users execute common commands by tapping on command buttons at the bottom of the screen. <br><a name="925453"> </a><br><li><strong>Menus</strong>. Commands not represented by command buttons can be accessed via a simple menu system. The user taps on a menu hard icon in the digitizer area to invoke a menu bar. Beginning in Palm OS 3.5, the user may also invoke a menu bar by tapping the form's title. Provide menu shortcuts if possible. <br><a name="925455"> </a><blockquote><hr><strong>NOTE: &nbsp</strong><p></p>If you provide shortcuts, make sure that each shortcut is unique among all commands available at that time. <hr><br></blockquote><a name="925456"> </a><br><li><strong>Graffiti menu command shortcuts</strong>. Users can write a special Graffiti stroke and a command keystroke to execute a menu command. This is analogous to keyboard shortcuts on a personal computer. For example, writing the command stroke symbol (a bottom-left to top-right line) and "C" allows the user to copy the selected text.<br><a name="927063"> </a><br><li><strong>Buttons on command toolbar.</strong> Beginning in Palm OS 3.5, entering the Graffiti command stroke symbol displays a command toolbar containing buttons for the commands that are possible in the current user context. For example, if text is selected in a field, the toolbar may display buttons for cut, copy, paste, and undo. Users may either complete the menu command shortcut as described above, or they may tap one of the buttons on the command toolbar. <br></ul></dl><a name="925458"> </a><h4> Guidelines for Screen Layout</h4><dl><a name="925459"> </a><p></p><dt>The illustration below provides some interface guidelines.

Then plan your application's interface, keeping in mind localization issues listed below. Also see the chapter <a href="Localization.html#924904">"Localized Applications"</a>, which describes guidelines for writing code in a localized application. <ul type="SQUARE"><a name="927112"> </a><br><li>If you use the English language version of the software as a guide when designing the layout of the screen, try to allow:<br><p></p><ul type="CIRCLE"><a name="927113"> </a><li>extra space for strings <a name="927114"> </a><li>larger dialogs than the English version requires</ul><a name="927167"> </a><br><li>Abbreviations may be the best way to accommodate the particularly scarce screen real estate on the Palm OS device. <br><a name="927125"> </a><br><li>Don't put language-dependent strings in code. If you have to display text directly on the screen, remember that a one-line warning or message in one language may need more than one line in another language. <br><a name="927153"> </a><br><li>Don't depend on the physical characteristics of a string, such as the number of characters, the fact that it contains a particular substring, or any other attribute that might disappear in translation. <br><a name="925563"> </a><br><li>Consider using string templates. For example, the MemoPad application uses the template: Memo # of %. The application can replace # and % to change the text. Use as many parameters as possible to give localizers greater flexibility. Avoid building sentences by concatenating substrings together, as this often causes translation problems. <br><a name="927090"> </a><br><li>Remember that user interface elements such as lists, fields, and tips scroll if you need more space. <br></ul></dl><a name="925567"> </a><h2> Making Your Application Run on Different Devices</h2><dl><a name="925568"> </a><p></p><dt>There are many different devices that run Palm OS, and each may have a different version of the OS installed on it (see <a href="Design.html#925581">Table 2.1</a>). Users are not expected to upgrade the Palm OS as frequently as they would an OS on a desktop computer. This fact makes backward compatibility more crucial for Palm applications. <p><a name="925841"> </a> </p><p><div> <table border="3"><caption><B><a name="925581"> </a><h4>Table 2.1	 Some Palm Computing platform devices&nbsp;</h4></B></caption><tr><th><a name="925585"> </a><strong>Name</strong></th><th><a name="925587"> </a><strong>Palm OS Version</strong></th></tr><tr><td><a name="925592"> </a>Pilot 1000<a href="#925591"><sup>1</sup></a></td><td><a name="925594"> </a>1.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925596"> </a>Pilot 5000<sup>a</sup></td><td><a name="925598"> </a>1.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925600"> </a>PalmPilot<sup>a</sup></td><td><a name="925602"> </a>2.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925604"> </a>PalmPilot Professional<sup>a</sup></td><td><a name="925606"> </a>2.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925608"> </a>Palm III<sup>&#153;</sup></td><td><a name="925610"> </a>3.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925612"> </a>IBM Workpad</td><td><a name="925614"> </a>2.0 or 3.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925616"> </a>Symbol SPT 1500</td><td><a name="925618"> </a>3.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925623"> </a>Qualcomm pdQ</td><td><a name="925625"> </a>3.0</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925627"> </a>Palm IIIe<sup>&#153;</sup></td><td><a name="925629"> </a>3.1</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925631"> </a>Palm IIIx<sup>&#153;</sup></td><td><a name="925633"> </a>3.1</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925635"> </a>Palm V<sup>&#153;</sup></td><td><a name="925637"> </a>3.1</td></tr><tr><td><a name="925639"> </a>Palm VII<sup>&#153;</sup></td><td><a name="925641"> </a>3.2 </td></tr><tr><td><a name="927195"> </a>Palm IIIc<sup>&#153;</sup></td><td><a name="927197"> </a>3.5</td></tr></table><table><tr><td><sup>1</sup><p><a name="925591"> </a> No longer available.</p></table></div></p><a name="925642"> </a><p></p><dt>This section describes how to make sure your application runs on as many devices as possible by discussing:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925646"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925652">Running New Applications on an Older Device</a><br><a name="925650"> </a><br><li><a href="Design.html#925666">Compiling Older Applications With The Latest SDK</a><br></ul></dl><a name="925652"> </a><h3> Running New Applications on an Older Device</h3><dl><a name="925653"> </a><p></p><dt>Releases of the Palm OS are binary compatible with each other. If you write a brand new application today, it can run on all versions of the operating system provided the application doesn't use any new features. In other words, if you write your application using only features available in Palm OS 1.0, then your application runs on all devices. If you use 2.0 features, your application won't run on the earliest Palm Computing platform devices, but it will run on all others, and so on. <a name="925654"> </a><p></p><dt>How can you tell which features are available in each version of the operating system? There are a couple of way to do so:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925658"> </a><br><li>The <em>Palm OS SDK Reference</em> has a <a href="CompatibilityApdx.html#483126">"Compatibility Guide"</a> appendix. This guide lists the feature and functions introduced in each operating system version greater than 1.0. <br><a name="925660"> </a><br><li>The header file <code>SysTraps.h</code> (or <code>CoreTraps.h</code> on Palm OS 3.5 and higher) lists all of the system traps available. Traps are listed in the order in which they were introduced to the system, and comments in the file clearly mark where each operating system version begins. <br></ul><a name="925661"> </a><p></p><dt>Programmatically, you can use the feature manager to determine which features are available on the system the application is running on. Note that you can't always rely on the operating system version number to guarantee that a feature exists. For example, Palm OS version 3.2 introduces wireless support, but not all Palm OS devices have that capability. Thus, checking that the system version is 3.2 does not guarantee that wireless support exists. Consult the <a href="CompatibilityApdx.html#483126">"Compatibility Guide"</a> in the <em>Palm OS SDK Reference</em> to learn how to check for the existence of each specific feature. </dl><a name="925666"> </a><h3> Compiling Older Applications With The Latest SDK</h3><dl><a name="925667"> </a><p></p><dt>As a rule, all Palm OS applications developed with an earlier version of the Palm Computing platform SDK should run error-free on the latest release. <a name="925668"> </a><p></p><dt>If you want to compile your older application under the latest release, you need to look out for functions with a changed API. For any of these functions, the old function still exists with an extension noting the release that supports it, such as V10 or V20.<a name="925669"> </a><p></p><dt>You can choose one of two options:<ul type="SQUARE"><a name="925670"> </a><br><li>Change the function name to keep using the old API. Your application will then run error free on the newer devices.<br><a name="925671"> </a><br><li>Update your application to use the new API. The application will then run error free and have access to some new functionality; however, it will no longer run on older devices that use prior releases of the OS.<br><a name="927209"> </a><blockquote><hr><strong>NOTE: &nbsp</strong><p></p>If you want to compile an existing application with the Palm OS 3.5 SDK, note that some header file names have changed, and the names used for basic types have changed. For example, parameters previously declared as <code>Word</code> are now <code>UInt16</code> or <code>Int16</code>. To compile existing applications, you'll need to make these changes in your code or include the header file <code>PalmOSCompatibility.h</code>. See the <a href="CompatibilityApdx.html#483126">"Compatibility Guide"</a> in the <em>Palm OS SDK Reference</em> for further details. <hr><br></blockquote></ul><a name="925691"> </a><p></p><dt><strong></strong></dl><hr><br><center><B>Palm OS Programmer's Companion</B></center><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%">  <TR>    <TD WIDTH=10%>&nbsp</TD>    <TD WIDTH=20%><a href="Nutshell.html"><IMG SRC="images/prev.html" BORDER=0 ALT="Previous Page"></TD>    <TD WIDTH=20%><a href="CompanionTOC.html"><IMG SRC="images/content.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Table of Contents"></TD>    <TD WIDTH=20%><a href="CompanionIX.html"><IMG SRC="images/index.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Index"></TD>    <TD WIDTH=20%><a href="AppStartupAndStop.html"><IMG SRC="images/next.html" BORDER=0 ALT="Next Page"></TD>    <TD WIDTH=10%>&nbsp</TD>  </TR></TABLE><br><small><em>This is page 71 of 85 in this book</em></small><hr><br><address><a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/">Palm Computing Platform Development Zone</a></address><i>Copyright &#169; 2000, Palm, Inc.
